## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.1](https://github.com/babichjacob/ac-qu-ai-nt/releases/tag/ac-qu-ai-nt-cli-clap-v0.0.1) - 2024-09-24

### Other

- add licenses and other required metadata to the crates
- initialize a Cargo workspace with a `cli-clap` and a `multibinary` package to align with how I want the project to work (wherein features can be turned off to optimize the resulting binary, and there are different interfaces (GUI vs TUI vs CLI vs just an API vs just a web app or any permutation of these) to choose from depending on the occasion)
